# Spelling

## Italian alphabet, accented letters

Italian is written using the Latin alphabet.

All the vowels can be modified by the grave accent, and *e* can be modified by an
acute accent too.

::: eg

*à è é ì ò ù*

:::

Accented 

Accents don't affect the pronunciation of the letter, they affect which syllable
is stressed.

::: eg

*Città* (city) is pronounced /cit-TA/.

*Pero* (pear tree) is pronounced /PE-ro/. *Però* (but) is pronounced /pe-RO/.

*Da* (from) and *dà* (give) mean very different things, but are both pronoucned /da/.

*Pèrdono* (they lose) and *perdòno* means "forgiveness" or "I forgive".

If you don't have access to accented letters you can use the letter followed by
a single apostrophe instead: *a\' e\' i\' o\' u\' -- A\' E\' I\' O\' U\'*.

Many natives (shamelessly) use apostrophes, especially when writing capital
letters (see [the photos here](https://italian.stackexchange.com/q/3878) for
examples), because there's no easy way to type capitalized and accented letters
on a computer.

## Capitalization rules

In Italian, the name of weekdays and months, adjectives that describe
nationalities and the first person pronoun aren't capitalized. Only names (given
names, names of places and organizations, etc...) are capitalized.

- John Doe, Mars, January, Monday, French, I
- Mario Rossi, Marte, gennaio, lunedì, francese, io

"Mario Rossi" is the [placeholder
name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeholder_name) used in Italian.

## Pronunciation

In English, pronounciation is all over the place, words are not read as they are
spelled. In Italian, it's consistent. For the sake of space, I won't include a
pronunciation guide here. I suggest [WordReference's
guide](https://www.wordreference.com/it/Pronuncia-Inglese.aspx?dict=enit).

English speakers in particular should practice pronuncing R's.

# Articles

The purpose of articles is to introduce 

In Italian, articles are used more often than they are in English. As a general
rule, if you're wondering "should I use an article here?" the answer is probably
"yes, you should".

## Indeterminate and determinate articles

*Passami **una** penna. Anzi, passami **la** penna blu.*

Pass me **a** pen. Actually, pass me **the** blue pen.


## Partitive articles

----

**Nouns as modifiers**. In English, nouns can be often modified by another noun.
For example:

- "Food" can become "cat food" or "dog food"
- "Bag" can become "plastic bag", "shopping bag"

In Italian, this is also  possible, but you have to use preposition between the nouns:

- Cibo, cibo per gatti, cibo per cani
- Busta, busta di plastica, busta della spesa

To figure out which preposition you should use, think about what preposition you
would use in English, and it's most likely the same in Italian.

- Food, food for cats, food for dogs
- Bag, bag made of plastic, bag 



## Grammatical agreement

**Notion of agreement**. Agreement is the idea that parts of speech must "agree"
with each other in gender and number.

**English has limited agreement**. In English, agreement is almost non-existent:
the only rule is that If you use a plural noun, you have to use the plural form
of a verb.

- The black cat meows.
- The black cats meow.

**Gender is relevant in Italian nouns**. In Italian, agreement is quite
extensive, and applies to articles, nouns, adjectives (both gender and number)
and verbs (only number).

- Il gatto nero miagola.
- I gatti neri miagolano.
- La gatta nera miagola.
- Il toro pigro, la mucca pigra.

# Articles and nouns

I will talk about articles and nouns in the same section, since they almost always go together.



They are used to talk about something in particular. English only has one, "the".

On the other hand, Italian has several. 

- Il, lo/l', la/l' (singular nouns)
- I, gli, le (plural nouns)


English only has two articles:

- The
- A/an

Their equivalents in Italian are:

- Il, lo, i, gli, la
- Uno/un, una/un'

# Sentence structure

- no inversion when asking questions
- no "does" when negating
- placing the object between the verb and preposition
- no placing the preposition at the end
